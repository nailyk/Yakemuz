Yakemuz
=======
[Android] Yakemuz is an Android app that identifies music from an audio capture (like Shazam). It relies on the Echonest API to send the fingerprint of the audio capture and receive details such as the artist, title, release name, links to Deezer / Spotify and Whosampled (http://www.whosampled.com/) platforms.

This project must include the Echoprint project as a library project (in eclipse), in order to generate the fingerprint of the song which will be send to the Echonest servers.
